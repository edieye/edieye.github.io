		<p>Time is linear.</p>
<p>Time is linear.</p>
<p>Time is linear.</p>
<p>That sounds aggressive but time is linear and I keep treating it as if it's circular. What do I mean? Well, I very often <em>wait</em> for things to be over and I very often <em>wait</em> for things to happen because, in the back of my mind, I know a cycle repeats itself. But that's the problem though, because it doesn't - time doesn't repeat itself.</p>
<p>There is much irony in time because we know it isn't promised yet we treat it as such. The reason could be that many of its attributes suggest a perpetual cycle. A minute is composed of sixty seconds, an hour of sixty minutes, a day of twenty-four hours, a week of seven days, and a year of fifty-two weeks. Every segment said above repeats itself and maybe that's the problem – we think we have time.</p>
<p>Below is an image where each square represents a week and each row a year. As there are ninety rows, this is your entire life if you live until ninety. Note: The image was taken from <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html">here</a>.
<img alt="90-year-timeline" src="/2020/06/time/images/90-year-timeline.png"></p>
<p>This photo scares me. A lot. Suppose I crossed the boxes out as the weeks passed like a calendar – one big X for each week until the big day presents itself. Suppose I colour each box with either green or red – green for when the number of good days surpass the bad for that week, and red otherwise. In both scenarios, I am frightened because I never imagined life to have a deadline. I mean, I did, but not like this.</p>
<p>That said, the photo gives me hope too. Because if I am to map / reduce my life to this chart, I want it to have a positive connotation. If I am to draw Xs', I want to draw each X with a smile. If I am to colour boxes, I want to have a plethora of green boxes.</p>
<p>But if I want said results, it means I have to take control of my life. It means I have to take action instead of just dreaming. Because that's the thing – anyone can dream.</p>
<p>Anyone can dream to travel but it only happens when a ticket is booked.</p>
<p>Anyone can dream to have a great body but it only happens with consistent exercise and a healthy diet.</p>
<p>Anyone can dream to be wealthy but it only happens with discipline and hard work.</p>
<p>So this post is a reminder to start now.</p>
<p><strong>Because those boxes are getting filled out either way.</strong></p>
