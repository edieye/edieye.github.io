<p>“Usually when people ask how I’m doing, the real answer is I’m doing shitty, but I can’t say I’m doing shitty, because I don’t even have a good reason to be doing shitty. So if I say, “I’m doing shitty” then they say, “why? what’s wrong?” And I have to be like, “ I don’t know, all of it?” So instead, when people ask me how I’m doing, I usually say, “I am doing so great.”- BoJack  <a href="https://www.pinterest.pt/pin/720364902878836038/">img</a> (Season 5, Episode 6)</p>

<p>If you are unfamiliar with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BoJack_Horseman">BoJack Horseman</a>, it is a dark, animated comedy encompassing a horse named BoJack (I know you couldn't tell from the title). He was previously a major celebrity – a direct result of his role in the 1990s sitcom Horsin' Around – and even more previously, a victim of childhood abuse. The show is brilliant for its capture of real-life obstacles (i.e. depression, trauma, self-destructive behavior, addiction, sexuality, and racism) that many humans face as we traverse through this thing called life. I applaud the show for its role on the destigmatization of mental health and rather than write a summary of the story, largely because I believe you should go watch it yourself if you haven't already, I have decided to use the allotted space (i.e. this site) to share my favorite quotes from the six seasons. As there will be spoilers, I have divided the quotes into sections by season and if you have a favorite quote that I missed, feel free to <a href="mailto:edieye_blog@hotmail.com">email</a> me. I have also attached, for those available, an image or video of the dialogue between the characters to jog your memory of its relevance in the story. I take no credit for any of the images or videos used – I am solely compiling this information for myself and other fans of the show.</p>

<h3>SEASON 5 <a name="FIVE"></a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Diane: "The real reason you go to Vietnam is because you see your accidentally soon-to-be ex-husband kiss someone else. At first you think, 'Oh, it's a fling. Whatever, they're drunk, it's a party. But then he puts his hand on the small of her back exactly the way he used to do to you. It means
I've got you, and when he did it to you, it made you feel safe.' And you realize he will never do that to you again.  And it breaks your heart, again after you heart was so broken that you thought it could never get anymore broken. You thought it was safe but it still, somehow, finds a new way to break. Because, even though you're the one who asked for this, now that you've got it, you are completely adrift with no compass, or map, or sense of where to go, or what to do. So you go to Vietnam. You think you might find community, a connection to something bigger, but.. you don't. In fact, you feel even more alone than you were before you left. But... you survive. You learn that you can survive being alone. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1i2vgV7VSuk">vid</a> (Episode 2)</p>

<p>BoJack : "We understood each other in a way, me and my mom and my dad. As screwed up as we all were, we did understand each other. My mother, she knew what it's like to feel your entire life like you're drowning with the exception of these moments, these very rare, brief instances, in which you suddenly remember... you can swim." <br>
BoJack : "But then again, mostly not. Mostly you're drowning. She understood that, too. And she recognized that I understood it. And Dad. All three of us were drowning, and we didn't know how to save each other, but there was an understanding that we were all drowning together." (Episode 6)</p>

<p>Butterscotch Horseman : "No, it's not her fault. She's doing the best she can, after all. It's just that, you can't depend on women. You can't depend on anyone. Sooner or later, you need to learn that no one else is gonna take care of you. That's what I learned when I had to make my own sandwich. You can't rely on other people, BoJack. It's good for you to know. And she's a good mother for teaching you that. You've got a head start on most kids. You're actually very lucky." (Episode 6)</p>

<p>BoJack : "I was in the hospital with her those last moments, and they were truly horrifying, full of nonsensical screams and cries, but there was this moment, this one instant of strange calm, where she looked in my direction and said, "I see you." That's the last thing she said to me. "I see you." Not a statement of judgment or disappointment, just acceptance and the simple recognition of another person in a room. "Hello, there. You are a person. And I see you." Let me tell you, it's a weird thing to feel at 54 years old, that for the first time in your life, your mother sees you. It's an odd realization that that's the thing you've been missing, the only thing you wanted all along, to be seen. And it doesn't feel like a relief, to finally be seen. It feels mean, like, "Oh, it turns out that you knew what I wanted, and you waited until the very last moment to give it to me." I was prepared for more cruelty. I was sure that she would get in one final zinger about how I let her down, and about how I was fat and stupid, and too tall to be an effective Lindy-hopper. How I was needy and a burden and an embarrassment. All that I was ready for. I was not ready for "I see you." Only my mother would be lousy enough to swipe me with a moment of connection on her way out. But maybe I'm giving her too much credit. Maybe it wasn't about connection. Maybe it was a... maybe it was an "I see you," like, "I see you." Like, "You might have the rest of the world fooled, but I know exactly who you are." That's more my mom's speed. Or maybe she just literally meant "I see you. You are an object that has entered my field of vision." She was pretty out of it at the end, so maybe it's dumb to try to attribute it to anything."

She used every secret she knew about me, every vulnerability. She made me miserable my entire sophomore year. But then that summer, when her mom got sick, like really sick, and all her cool friends were off vacationing in Martha's Vineyard, I was there for her." <br>
BoJack : "Why?" <br>
Diane : "Because I'm an idiot. And it was Abby. And I hated her, and I will never forgive her, but she needed me, and... she was my best friend, and I loved her. And now... you're here, and I hate you, but you're my best friend, and you need me." (Episode 12)
