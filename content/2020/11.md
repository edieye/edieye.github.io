Time is linear.

Time is linear.

Time is linear.

That sounds aggressive but time is linear and I keep treating it as if it's circular. What do I mean? Well, I very often _wait_ for things to be over and I very often _wait_ for things to happen because, in the back of my mind, I know a cycle repeats itself. But that's the problem though, because it doesn't - time doesn't repeat itself.

There is much irony in time because we know it isn't promised yet we treat it as such. The reason could be that many of its attributes suggest a perpetual cycle. A minute is composed of sixty seconds, an hour of sixty minutes, a day of twenty-four hours, a week of seven days, and a year of fifty-two weeks. Every segment said above repeats itself and maybe that's the problem – we think we have time.

Below is an image where each square represents a week and each row a year. As there are ninety rows, this is your entire life if you live until ninety. Note: The image was taken from [here](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html).

This photo scares me. A lot. Suppose I crossed the boxes out as the weeks passed like a calendar – one big X for each week until the big day presents itself. Suppose I colour each box with either green or red – green for when the number of good days surpass the bad for that week, and red otherwise. In both scenarios, I am frightened because I never imagined life to have a deadline. I mean, I did, but not like this.

That said, the photo gives me hope too. Because if I am to map / reduce my life to this chart, I want it to have a positive connotation. If I am to draw Xs', I want to draw each X with a smile. If I am to colour boxes, I want to have a plethora of green boxes.

But if I want said results, it means I have to take control of my life. It means I have to take action instead of just dreaming. Because that's the thing – anyone can dream.

Anyone can dream to travel but it only happens when a ticket is booked.

Anyone can dream to have a great body but it only happens with consistent exercise and a healthy diet.

Anyone can dream to be wealthy but it only happens with discipline and hard work.

So this post is a reminder to start now.

__Because those boxes are getting filled out either way.__
