I'm a BSc. graduate from the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/) with a focus in computer science and am based in [Vancouver, Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver). I began my career as an engineering intern at [Terramera](https://www.terramera.com/) in 2017 and in 2018, I worked on [Storagegrid 11.1](http://docs.netapp.com/sgws-111/index.jsp) at [Netapp](https://www.netapp.com/us/index.aspx) and on [Crystal Reports for Enterprise 4.2](https://help.sap.com/viewer/product/SAP_CRYSTAL_REPORTS_FOR_ENTERPRISE/4.2/en-US) at [SAP](https://www.sap.com/canada/index.html) Vancouver. Currently, I am a full time developer at [PayByPhone](https://www.paybyphone.com/) in [Vancouver, BC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver). I am an avid hiker, a huge fan of [The Office](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0386676/), a traveller at heart, and a writer. If you want to talk more about The Office, about any of my previous experiences, or have any general questions, feel free to connect with me!
