&lt;p&gt;problems, those suck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;even before you were born – nine months earlier – you could have already been a nascent problem. perhaps, your parents weren’t excepting you. perhaps it wasn’t the right time. perhaps they were encumbered by their financial ability. perhaps, they weren’t ready. perhaps, it was for a different reason altogether. perhaps…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i mean, it hurts right, to realize you could have been a burden to someone else even prior to developing in the womb? well, it doesn’t get better because from the moment you leave the womb and deafen your parents and until the day of your last breath, you are a problem. possibly, even thereafter. hence the funeral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but maybe problems are good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that is, you exist, right? you, a &lt;a href="https://www.wboc.com/story/43554205/the-chances-of-you-being-born-are-far-lower-than-you-think"&gt;one in four trillion fluke&lt;/a&gt;, exist. that in itself is a miracle and should be celebrated as such. it should be celebrated because in an infinitely problematic world hosting an infinite number of problems, you just so happen to exist. those are the odds and that is, with the given presuppositions, irrefutable.
when i was four, i was extremely attached to my grandpa. at the time, there was an inexplicable, phenomenal bond i shared with him that i’ve yet to and don’t plan to share with another individual. looking back, it was probably because he coddled me; he was a yes-man, so whenever we passed by a grocery store and i asked, he would procure candy for me. he was an over-protective guardian, so whenever i had conflicts with my siblings and or cousins, he would take my side. he was, without a doubt, the ideal grandparent anyone could wish for at that age. he sheltered me from the cruel but very real outside world, and it was amazing. that is, until we had to separate for a period of time because of pre-school.
on the first day he tried to drop me off, he couldn’t leave. he had to stand by the door and watch over me. i, despite being able to play with the toys and other children, would consistently glance over to ensure his presence. whenever he futilely attempted to escape my vision, i would freeze and cry. i bawled my eyes dry that day. that said, i eventually learned to function without his companionship albeit it may have taken copious amounts of time; it was both a process and a compromise: i made him promise to stay a little longer before leaving and to arrive a little earlier to pick me up, and in turn, i wouldn’t make a scene. in time, i warmed up to the other kids and made friends even.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;reflecting on this experience and me being embarrassed aside, what stood out for me was the introduction of a problem (i.e. me) via an over-cautious grandparent (i.e. him). in a way, he solved all my problems until i, myself, became the problem. by sheltering me, by coddling me, by leaving me to be invulnerable, he made me vulnerable. it’s &lt;a href="http://www.brooklyntherapist.net/blog/2018/6/12/alan-watts-backwards-law"&gt;Watt’s backwards law&lt;/a&gt; – the more you try to hold onto something, the more it slips through the crevices of your hand; the more you try to control a situation, the more it controls you; the more you try to avoid musing over a problem, the more you end up musing over it.
now, my grandpa isn’t to blame because how can i blame someone with pure and loving intentions? furthermore, i wouldn’t alter the past, as with its multitudes of problems, it has also helped to mould my becoming. i like to believe that everyone has a set of problems starting at the physiological level and culminating at self-actualization. Maslow refers to these as needs but i refer to them as problems. i like to believe that life has myriad problems; whenever a problem is resolved, another takes its place. when you’re in pre-school, the problems are simpler – math puzzles, shapes matching, or in my case, separation anxiety. when you’re in school, the problems are replaced with making friends, fostering relationships, keeping up with your education and so forth. on this basis, i have an inkling that problems are on-going but with this inkling, i somehow feel more free. it’s Watt’s backwards law again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;under the premise that problems are on-going and perpetual, the one thing i ask of you is to experience things a little. drink a gallon of water a day even if you have to pee every hour. wake up at four am to hike for fourteen hours even if you know your legs are going to be sore the next day. run an arduous marathon even if you can’t remember the last time running has crossed your mind. read ten books in one sitting even if you haven’t picked up a book in ages. fall asleep for a twenty-four hour duration even if you can’t remember the last time you’ve slept well. call your grandparents and tell them you love them even if you haven’t connected in a while. i don’t know – just live a little because problems will continue to exist, and at times, feel insurmountable even.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so don’t try to live a life without a problems as that’s impossible. rather, try to live a life with problems you find worth solving and have a little fun along the way, because thats’s what is meaningful. that’s what is going to feel good. and that’s what you’re going to remember.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="2021"></category><category term="problems"></category><category term="self"></category><category term="time"></category></entry><entry><title>I WANT TO BE EVERYTHING</title><link href="/2020/09/i-want-to-be-everything/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-09-27T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2020-09-27T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>EDIE YE</name></author><id>tag:None,2020-09-27:/2020/09/i-want-to-be-everything/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I want to be everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to learn about psychology – to understand why people are the way they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to learn about construction – to design and develop my own home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to learn about philosophy –  to question the universe and the fundamental nature of our existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to learn and be everything, but that's impossible. &lt;em&gt;Or so I've heard.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just kidding – that’s the reality. That said, there is this unshakeable part of me that is unwilling to give up on anything. Don't get me wrong, I give up on things. Everyone does, everyday. But it hasn't gotten easier and it probably never will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is this – when you make a choice or transaction, you give something up. The simplest transaction is exchanging a good for money (i.e. giving up money for said good). In an ideal world, you would keep both the money and good but that isn't possible in most scenarios, to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now take the same idea and extend it to every decision you've made in your life. In the beginning, there is infinite potential. You are free to be anything you want. As choices are made, the choices that follow become more and more narrow. But more and more significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The college you attend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The field you major in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first internship or job you take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The place you settle down in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The person you spend your life with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite having made some of those decisions and loving the choices I've made, I've come to the realization that there is much more that I want to learn and unwilling to give up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because I don't want to give anything up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still want to be everything.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="2020"></category><category term="self"></category><category term="time"></category></entry><entry><title>TIME</title><link href="/2020/06/time/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-06-14T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2020-06-14T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>EDIE YE</name></author><id>tag:None,2020-06-14:/2020/06/time/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Time is linear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time is linear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That sounds aggressive but time is linear and I keep treating it as if it's circular. What do I mean?

&lt;p&gt;Time is linear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time is linear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That sounds aggressive but time is linear and I keep treating it as if it's circular. What do I mean? Well, I very often &lt;em&gt;wait&lt;/em&gt; for things to be over and I very often &lt;em&gt;wait&lt;/em&gt; for things to happen because, in the back of my mind, I know a cycle repeats itself. But that's the problem though, because it doesn't - time doesn't repeat itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is much irony in time because we know it isn't promised yet we treat it as such. The reason could be that many of its attributes suggest a perpetual cycle. A minute is composed of sixty seconds, an hour of sixty minutes, a day of twenty-four hours, a week of seven days, and a year of fifty-two weeks. Every segment said above repeats itself and maybe that's the problem – we think we have time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is an image where each square represents a week and each row a year. As there are ninety rows, this is your entire life if you live until ninety. Note: The image was taken from &lt;a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;img alt="90-year-timeline" src="/2020/06/time/images/90-year-timeline.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This photo scares me. A lot. Suppose I crossed the boxes out as the weeks passed like a calendar – one big X for each week until the big day presents itself. Suppose I colour each box with either green or red – green for when the number of good days surpass the bad for that week, and red otherwise. In both scenarios, I am frightened because I never imagined life to have a deadline. I mean, I did, but not like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, the photo gives me hope too. Because if I am to map / reduce my life to this chart, I want it to have a positive connotation. If I am to draw Xs', I want to draw each X with a smile. If I am to colour boxes, I want to have a plethora of green boxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if I want said results, it means I have to take control of my life. It means I have to take action instead of just dreaming. Because that's the thing – anyone can dream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone can dream to travel but it only happens when a ticket is booked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone can dream to have a great body but it only happens with consistent exercise and a healthy diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone can dream to be wealthy but it only happens with discipline and hard work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this post is a reminder to start now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Because those boxes are getting filled out either way.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="2020"></category><category term="life"></category><category term="time"></category></entry></feed>
