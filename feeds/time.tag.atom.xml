&lt;p&gt;I want to learn about psychology – to understand why people are the way they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to learn about construction – to design and develop my own home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to learn about philosophy –  to question the universe and the fundamental nature of our existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to learn and be everything, but that's impossible. &lt;em&gt;Or so I've heard.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just kidding – that’s the reality. That said, there is this unshakeable part of me that is unwilling to give up on anything. Don't get me wrong, I give up on things. Everyone does, everyday. But it hasn't gotten easier and it probably never will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is this – when you make a choice or transaction, you give something up. The simplest transaction is exchanging a good for money (i.e. giving up money for said good). In an ideal world, you would keep both the money and good but that isn't possible in most scenarios, to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now take the same idea and extend it to every decision you've made in your life. In the beginning, there is infinite potential. You are free to be anything you want. As choices are made, the choices that follow become more and more narrow. But more and more significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The college you attend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The field you major in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first internship or job you take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The place you settle down in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The person you spend your life with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite having made some of those decisions and loving the choices I've made, I've come to the realization that there is much more that I want to learn and unwilling to give up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because I don't want to give anything up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still want to be everything.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="2020"></category><category term="self"></category><category term="time"></category></entry><entry><title>TIME</title><link href="/2020/06/time/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-06-14T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2020-06-14T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>EDIE YE</name></author><id>tag:None,2020-06-14:/2020/06/time/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Time is linear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time is linear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time is linear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That sounds aggressive but time is linear and I keep treating it as if it's circular. What do I mean? Well, I very often &lt;em&gt;wait&lt;/em&gt; for things to be over and I very often &lt;em&gt;wait&lt;/em&gt; for things to happen because, in …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Time is linear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time is linear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time is linear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That sounds aggressive but time is linear and I keep treating it as if it's circular. What do I mean? Well, I very often &lt;em&gt;wait&lt;/em&gt; for things to be over and I very often &lt;em&gt;wait&lt;/em&gt; for things to happen because, in the back of my mind, I know a cycle repeats itself. But that's the problem though, because it doesn't - time doesn't repeat itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is much irony in time because we know it isn't promised yet we treat it as such. The reason could be that many of its attributes suggest a perpetual cycle. A minute is composed of sixty seconds, an hour of sixty minutes, a day of twenty-four hours, a week of seven days, and a year of fifty-two weeks. Every segment said above repeats itself and maybe that's the problem – we think we have time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is an image where each square represents a week and each row a year. As there are ninety rows, this is your entire life if you live until ninety. Note: The image was taken from &lt;a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;img alt="90-year-timeline" src="/2020/06/time/images/90-year-timeline.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This photo scares me. A lot. Suppose I crossed the boxes out as the weeks passed like a calendar – one big X for each week until the big day presents itself. Suppose I colour each box with either green or red – green for when the number of good days surpass the bad for that week, and red otherwise. In both scenarios, I am frightened because I never imagined life to have a deadline. I mean, I did, but not like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, the photo gives me hope too. Because if I am to map / reduce my life to this chart, I want it to have a positive connotation. If I am to draw Xs', I want to draw each X with a smile. If I am to colour boxes, I want to have a plethora of green boxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if I want said results, it means I have to take control of my life. It means I have to take action instead of just dreaming. Because that's the thing – anyone can dream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone can dream to travel but it only happens when a ticket is booked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone can dream to have a great body but it only happens with consistent exercise and a healthy diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone can dream to be wealthy but it only happens with discipline and hard work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this post is a reminder to start now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Because those boxes are getting filled out either way.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="2020"></category><category term="life"></category><category term="time"></category></entry></feed>
