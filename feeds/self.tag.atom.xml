&lt;p&gt;problems, those suck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;even before you were born – nine months earlier – you could have already been a nascent problem. perhaps, your parents weren’t excepting you. perhaps it wasn’t the right time. perhaps they were encumbered by their financial ability. perhaps, they weren’t ready. perhaps, it was for a different reason altogether. perhaps…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i mean, it hurts right, to realize you could have been a burden to someone else even prior to developing in the womb? well, it doesn’t get better because from the moment you leave the womb and deafen your parents and until the day of your last breath, you are a problem. possibly, even thereafter. hence the funeral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but maybe problems are good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that is, you exist, right? you, a &lt;a href="https://www.wboc.com/story/43554205/the-chances-of-you-being-born-are-far-lower-than-you-think"&gt;one in four trillion fluke&lt;/a&gt;, exist. that in itself is a miracle and should be celebrated as such. it should be celebrated because in an infinitely problematic world hosting an infinite number of problems, you just so happen to exist. those are the odds and that is, with the given presuppositions, irrefutable.
when i was four, i was extremely attached to my grandpa. at the time, there was an inexplicable, phenomenal bond i shared with him that i’ve yet to and don’t plan to share with another individual. looking back, it was probably because he coddled me; he was a yes-man, so whenever we passed by a grocery store and i asked, he would procure candy for me. he was an over-protective guardian, so whenever i had conflicts with my siblings and or cousins, he would take my side. he was, without a doubt, the ideal grandparent anyone could wish for at that age. he sheltered me from the cruel but very real outside world, and it was amazing. that is, until we had to separate for a period of time because of pre-school.
on the first day he tried to drop me off, he couldn’t leave. he had to stand by the door and watch over me. i, despite being able to play with the toys and other children, would consistently glance over to ensure his presence. whenever he futilely attempted to escape my vision, i would freeze and cry. i bawled my eyes dry that day. that said, i eventually learned to function without his companionship albeit it may have taken copious amounts of time; it was both a process and a compromise: i made him promise to stay a little longer before leaving and to arrive a little earlier to pick me up, and in turn, i wouldn’t make a scene. in time, i warmed up to the other kids and made friends even.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;reflecting on this experience and me being embarrassed aside, what stood out for me was the introduction of a problem (i.e. me) via an over-cautious grandparent (i.e. him). in a way, he solved all my problems until i, myself, became the problem. by sheltering me, by coddling me, by leaving me to be invulnerable, he made me vulnerable. it’s &lt;a href="http://www.brooklyntherapist.net/blog/2018/6/12/alan-watts-backwards-law"&gt;Watt’s backwards law&lt;/a&gt; – the more you try to hold onto something, the more it slips through the crevices of your hand; the more you try to control a situation, the more it controls you; the more you try to avoid musing over a problem, the more you end up musing over it.
now, my grandpa isn’t to blame because how can i blame someone with pure and loving intentions? furthermore, i wouldn’t alter the past, as with its multitudes of problems, it has also helped to mould my becoming. i like to believe that everyone has a set of problems starting at the physiological level and culminating at self-actualization. Maslow refers to these as needs but i refer to them as problems. i like to believe that life has myriad problems; whenever a problem is resolved, another takes its place. when you’re in pre-school, the problems are simpler – math puzzles, shapes matching, or in my case, separation anxiety. when you’re in school, the problems are replaced with making friends, fostering relationships, keeping up with your education and so forth. on this basis, i have an inkling that problems are on-going but with this inkling, i somehow feel more free. it’s Watt’s backwards law again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;under the premise that problems are on-going and perpetual, the one thing i ask of you is to experience things a little. drink a gallon of water a day even if you have to pee every hour. wake up at four am to hike for fourteen hours even if you know your legs are going to be sore the next day. run an arduous marathon even if you can’t remember the last time running has crossed your mind. read ten books in one sitting even if you haven’t picked up a book in ages. fall asleep for a twenty-four hour duration even if you can’t remember the last time you’ve slept well. call your grandparents and tell them you love them even if you haven’t connected in a while. i don’t know – just live a little because problems will continue to exist, and at times, feel insurmountable even.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so don’t try to live a life without a problems as that’s impossible. rather, try to live a life with problems you find worth solving and have a little fun along the way, because thats’s what is meaningful. that’s what is going to feel good. and that’s what you’re going to remember.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="2021"></category><category term="problems"></category><category term="self"></category><category term="time"></category></entry><entry><title>I WANT TO BE EVERYTHING</title><link href="/2020/09/i-want-to-be-everything/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-09-27T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2020-09-27T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>EDIE YE</name></author><id>tag:None,2020-09-27:/2020/09/i-want-to-be-everything/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I want to be everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to learn about psychology – to understand why people are the way they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to learn about construction – to design and develop my own home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to learn about philosophy –  to question the universe and the fundamental nature of our existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to learn and be everything, but that's impossible. &lt;em&gt;Or so I've heard.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just kidding – that’s the reality. That said, there is this unshakeable part of me that is unwilling to give up on anything. Don't get me wrong, I give up on things. Everyone does, everyday. But it hasn't gotten easier and it probably never will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is this – when you make a choice or transaction, you give something up. The simplest transaction is exchanging a good for money (i.e. giving up money for said good). In an ideal world, you would keep both the money and good but that isn't possible in most scenarios, to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now take the same idea and extend it to every decision you've made in your life. In the beginning, there is infinite potential. You are free to be anything you want. As choices are made, the choices that follow become more and more narrow. But more and more significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The college you attend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The field you major in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first internship or job you take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The place you settle down in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The person you spend your life with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite having made some of those decisions and loving the choices I've made, I've come to the realization that there is much more that I want to learn and unwilling to give up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because I don't want to give anything up.&lt;/p&gt;

this task or when that event happens. This and that. Wait. It’s almost as if my mind doesn’t want
me to live my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do I mean? I mean I keep trying to set myself up. I justify my struggle with an end goal. I tell myself once I finish highschool, once I graduate from university, once I find my significant other, once I start my mortgage–I’ll start living. It’s a means to an end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t want to wake up one day not having really lived my life. I don’t want to wake up one day wondering why time passed so &lt;em&gt;damn fast.&lt;/em&gt; I don’t want to be nostalgic of a life that I never even lived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always tell myself I know the perfect life exists–I just need to finish everything at hand. Then I’ll be happy. I tell myself the vision of an ideal life is within my grasp—I just need to skip some pages of my story. I have become so enamoured with looking ahead that I have forgotten to live for the now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to start treasuring things. I want to start treasuring every late night conversation I have, every sunset and sunrise I witness, and every opportunity I get to spend with my family and friends. Because this is it.

That said, a fundamental problem to such answers is the possible controversy that can arise. The reason being is that success tends to fall in the hands of the beholder, meaning that there is no universal truth to success that is shared amongst everyone. The sub-questions that then follow are “How do you measure success?” or even more simply, “What is the definition of success?” The &lt;a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/webster-s-dictionary"&gt;Webster Dictionary&lt;/a&gt; defines
&lt;a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/success"&gt;success&lt;/a&gt; as “the fact of getting or achieving, wealth, respect or fame” which again, can be the definition for some people or the majority even, but that definition is not universal. At different points in life, the definitions and or measurements of success change. For this reason, I will write more on what intrinsic traits a successful person possesses rather than trying to draw a picture of a successful person. Although I am by no means at the stage where I can label myself as successful per se, I will delve into this topic further by sharing some of my successful experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the earliest memories I have of my childhood takes me back to my first days or week of preschool. I, for whatever reason, was riddled with separation anxiety from my grandpa, who at the time, was not only my guardian, but my best friend as well. It was honestly a strange concept because I remembered each child that was dropped off by a family member or guardian, and their ability to immediately interact with children and toys around them after being dropped off. Anyways, my grandpa had to remain with me while I interacted with the other kids and I remember every time he made a futile attempt to sneak away, I would cry almost immediately. The whole process of me getting comfortable with everyone took around a week and, if I remember correctly, it wasn’t until that period was over that I was able to be without the presence of my grandpa. While this may be seen as an embarrassment to others or a questionable experience even, it was my first memorable taste of victory and success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;BE PATIENT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In hindsight, there are a number of general accomplishments that happen in our lives whether we realize this or not, not limited to but including learning to walk, to read, or even to use the toilet. While these events have transpired quite a period of time ago, it is important to recognize the amount of time and energy that went into being successful with these tasks. This brings me to the first attribute of being successful—learning to &lt;strong&gt;be patient.&lt;/strong&gt; As cliche as it sounds, success is not something that happens over night. I say this because as a child, I believe that one of the traits many of us shared was not giving up easily and having the courage to attempt new activities, hence being able to effectively learn to verbally communicate, socially interact with others, etc. Speaking entirely for myself, I realized as I grew older, I saw a shift in how much quicker I would need to see results before deeming activities as worth the time. I saw while I was learning to be more patient with others, how impatient I was when it came to myself. The reason behind this is as I grew older, I learned more about myself. When I say learning more about myself, I mean understanding my goals, aspirations, likes, and dislikes. I mean having expectations for myself, which I hold to the highest standard. While it is so, so important to have goals and aspirations, this is a reminder to myself and everyone to be patient with not only the people around them but with themselves as well because success will come with time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;BE RESPECTFUL&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was fifteen, I took on my first job at the &lt;a href="https://www.pne.ca/"&gt;PNE&lt;/a&gt; as a sweeper and this has been rewarding in every aspect. It was not the job duties itself that was monumental nor was there a life changing event that took my breath away. However, it taught me about the value of money (because your sweat translating to your first pay cheque is a woohoo moment), about consistency, and most importantly, about hard work. I then went on to pick up other work prior to the beginning of my software development career, including serving in a restaurant, working in retail, working in concession stands, and even working as a manager in my high school store. If you want to read more about where I interned or where I am currently working you can read more &lt;a href="edieye.ca/about"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Needless to say, I would love to go into detail about each of my work experiences, but it would stray too far from the point I am trying to establish—learning to treat everyone you meet with respect and as an opportunity to learn. &lt;strong&gt;Being respectful&lt;/strong&gt; is of great value and realizing that every person you meet can teach you something will never, ever hinder your growth. This is because the people you meet can teach you what to be and what not to be. I believe, every now and then, quite unintentionally, someone teaches you something about yourself. I say this because I remember serving at a restaurant and witnessing dishwashers being treated poorly by some servers. I remember there was a basket which was intended for the server to put their dirty dishes in. Some servers, out of laziness, would toss dishes that still had food remains into the said basket and remains or sauces would deflect back onto the dishwashers’ clothes or face, even. Of course, this was of the rarest occasions and, of course, the servers apologized but there was, without a doubt, a blatant disregard for the dishwasher. Had it been someone of a deemed, valuable position, I doubt the dishes would have been carelessly tossed into the basket. Yes, I am elucidating the impression that some people are condescending and mistreat others and yes, I am asking you to not behave in this manner because not only is it a backwards movement, but it hinders growth. It is beneficial to recognize the value of every person you meet and every experience that takes place because growth comes from reflection, and not from exuding negativity towards others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;BE CONFIDENT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last trait I want to talk about is one I struggled with for a good period of time—&lt;strong&gt;being confident.&lt;/strong&gt; I say this to the people that don’t believe they have what it takes to take themselves to the level they aspire to be to find the courage to do so. My prior anecdote about my preschool experience is a translation for the parts of my life where I honestly felt uncomfortable being under my own skin. Truth is, you have to put yourself in uncomfortable situations because these situations will eventually become comfortable to you. For example, take a look at typing with a keyboard. At one point in our lives, we probably used two index fingers and had trouble typing a complete sentence without looking up at the screen. After finishing the sentence, being slightly smug about it, and then looking at our screen again, we probably realized that we had mistyped. &lt;em&gt;How uncomfortable.&lt;/em&gt; I understand that for some people, even getting out of bed and having basic conversation with others can be exhausting, but recognize that as long as you take baby steps to work on being comfortable with the uncomfortable, the confidence will eventually come! With that said, it is also important to recognize the difference between being arrogant and confident. As &lt;a href="https://theoffice.fandom.com/wiki/Vikram"&gt;Vikram&lt;/a&gt; would say, “confidence, it’s the food of the wise man, but the liquor of the fool.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many traits that can help lead one to success but those are the three I am trying to work on in the coming year and I know how cliche these traits are made out to be. Truth is, everything in life is cliche. The idea that you are very different from someone else is only true if you consider a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree"&gt;decision tree&lt;/a&gt;, where each step or decision would alter the course of life. However, these branches very often intersect and lead to a similar path. Even the idea that you think you are different is not much different than the other millions of people that have shared this thought , and with that said, I truly believe anyone can feel or be successful regardless of how many bad branches that stemmed from their tree. I have digressed again but I believe success is intrinsic and can not be answered with some social status or some physical good. Success is ultimately looking in the mirror and liking what you see.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="2020"></category><category term="pelican"></category><category term="self"></category><category term="patience"></category><category term="memory"></category><category term="success"></category><category term="life"></category><category term="confidence"></category></entry><entry><title>WHY I STARTED WRITING</title><link href="/2019/12/why-i-started-writing/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-12-02T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2019-12-02T00:00:00-08:00</updated><author><name>EDIE YE</name></author><id>tag:None,2019-12-02:/2019/12/why-i-started-writing/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;When asked why I decided to write, my knee jerk response would be why not?

However, the analytical side of me wants to explore the not-so-bright part of my brain that is actively encouraging me to document part of my, very much, mundane life.  For the people reading that don’t know me very well or just happened to stumble on this page, I want to apologize in advance for the plethora of &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0386676/"&gt;The Office&lt;/a&gt; references which is what I am fundamentally built on, as one of my friends would put it. To add to this, the focus of my posts are not for motivation, so if you are reading this with the intent of finding some sort of light to drive you or the means to fill an existing void, then you are probably looking in the wrong place. With that in mind, hopefully, you do find my experiences insightful and worth the read. My posts will largely be personal and I hope to share all my experiences, for regardless of whether they  were blessings or valuable experiences that did not immediately present themselves, they helped to shape me as an individual. Lastly, I want my blog to act as an unconfined space on the Internet where I can freely write about, well, anything that comes to mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us start with a brief biography about myself; I am a Bachelors of Science graduate from the University of British Columbia with a focus in computer science and am based in Vancouver, Canada. I am an avid hiker during the summer and watch The Office religiously, hence the occasional references. Another point that I can share about myself is that I was fortunate enough to be able to find an area of study (i.e. computer science) which I thoroughly enjoy. That being said, it honestly wasn’t a clear path to begin with and even when I decided with computer science, there were quite a few hurdles to overcome. I will probably expand further on the ins and outs of the reasons I decided to partake in my software development journey in a post or a portion of a post to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result of me pursuing computer science has resulted in me to take on a more structured approach to thinking about problems and while this has been rewarding in many aspects, one of the spaces I no longer found myself in was creative writing. This is not to say that programming lacks a creative side, as there are multiple solutions to a single problem and many developers tackle problems in a different manner. However, I missed the freedom of having my mind sporadically run off on a tangent. In other words, I wasn’t able to find the type of freedom in my everyday activities that creative writing allows for. While structured approaches and logic are great for reasoning and explaining problems as one can map out points from A to B and from B to C, I believe there is a creative outlet in writing that can’t be tapped from logic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another reason I decided to write after much consideration is that I wanted to leave a digital footprint that I can look back on when feeling nostalgic. One of the cruel realities of life is not being wired to remember all the highlights of our lives. While technologies such as the camera or video recorder have given us the ability to capture these moments in real time, there are periods in our lives where it would be inappropriate to use such technologies (e.g. movie theater). Moreover, I believe that even when the moments are appropriate to capture through technology, writing can simply act as an extension to these captured memories. Writing allows for the time to collect thoughts and emotions to reflect on specific moments in time. Lastly, I once was a firm believer in not capturing moments with photos or videos as I didn’t think you were seizing the moment with the presence of your phone. Nonetheless, after realizing that our brains are not structured to remember every immaculate detail of an experience, it makes logical sense to capture at least part of the experience prior to putting the technologies away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of primal instinct suggests that humans, as a species, are motivated by self-preservation and survival which complies with &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwinism"&gt;Darwin’s Theory of Evolution&lt;/a&gt;. The reason I bring this up is that I believe that it is an instinct to want to protect yourself, an instinct to want to be cherished, and an instinct to want to compete. To accentuate my point, when we look at &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection"&gt;natural selection&lt;/a&gt;, we can see there are many animals with cannibalistic tendencies and this can be seen as basic competition. Now, fortunately for us, the majority of animals and humans in contemporary society have evolved to not compete to this extent as somewhere along the way, we learned about compassion. Having said all that, I do believe that humans, when pushed to extremes, can and will release their buried anger in forms of hostility. This is why we have hobbies, loved ones, and other forms of stress relievers to suppress this innate behavior. I know I did run off on a tangent there, but I guess what I want to say is one of the reasons for the creation of this blog is to allow my mind to wander and release the stresses that come with ordinary, everyday living. I hope that answers why I am writing and if it still doesn’t, my response would again be, why not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading about a very ordinary post from my very ordinary life. Feel free to leave suggestions for what topics you want me to cover or things I could improve on as any constructive feedback would be greatly appreciated. Hopefully this post urges you to find a passion or hobby that takes away the stresses of everyday living and helps you to realize that it is quite alright to be ordinary. As &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pam_Beesly"&gt;Pam&lt;/a&gt; would say, “there’s a lot of beauty in ordinary things. Isn’t that the point?”&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="2019"></category><category term="pelican"></category><category term="publishing"></category><category term="self"></category><category term="blog"></category></entry></feed>
