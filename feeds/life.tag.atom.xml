Let me rephrase that — my mom is very powerful, period. This is not because she practices &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tai_chi"&gt;Tai chi&lt;/a&gt; (despite this being how she sees it), but because of her ability to shut me up by just looking at me. I don't know if the calm, infamous stare is a parenting technique or an asian parenting technique; the only certainty is that the calm stare is fueled by anger that can and will end me, if needed. The beauty, however, is in the inverse relationship between how angry she is and how calm she appears — the calmer she is, the more angry she eventually will become. It is ever so frightening simply because I love my mom an abnormal amount – more than I am willing to tell her. It probably has to do with her almost giving me up for adoption when I was younger. Just kidding. She could never. She is an incredible woman and mom despite me not being the best child growing up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the former years of elementary school, it was pretty much social suicide to display any form of affection to a person of the opposite gender, let alone your mom. This was very apparent when my mom continued to pick me up and greet me with a hug after school – even in the third grade. I mean, it was fine between kindergarten and the second grade, but by the third (come on now), I was basically as grown and as independent as I am today. Despite that day being more than a decade ago, I still remember it clearly. I remember how she beamed with joy and how her arms were wide open as she approached me, as if she was a human shield sheltering me from the cruel world that surrounded us. But nope. &lt;em&gt;Absolutely not.&lt;/em&gt; Her little boy had grown up. I ducked to elude the warm hug she tried to greet me with, smiled and said “not here, mom.” Little did I know that my actions were colder than day old oatmeal and I could still see the hurt in her face to this day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am lucky because she either doesn’t remember or she chooses not to remind me of that experience. Come to think of it, my mom is much cooler than I am. Aside from her great affection for her children and her incredible will to practice Tai Chi, she volunteers a bunch and has a good number of friends. Her jam-packed schedule and her ability to follow through with it every day is a demonstration of her tenacity and a reminder that I have yet to live up to my potential. I honestly would be lying if I said I wasn’t a bit jealous of how courageous she was, having transitioned to a foreign country with not a dollar to her name in an attempt to build a better life for her and her family. This is not to say she does not nag me constantly or pull rank on me to remind me where I stand because she does – and she does a damn good job of it. However, my relationship with my mom and our understanding of each other has gotten better over the years, but like all things, it has and will continue to have its share of struggle and hardship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It was tough growing up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lunch was awful. Just awful. For a good part of my elementary years, she packed leftover rice, huge portions of vegetables, and smeared bits of meat – it was garbage made with love and she had the audacity to call it &lt;em&gt;lunch.&lt;/em&gt; The vegetable to meat ratio was so embarrassing that I refuse to share that information to this day. On top of that, a good portion of my classmates had sandwiches for lunch – so you can imagine the discomfort I felt standing out, eating my &lt;em&gt;love-filled rice.&lt;/em&gt; I remember how elated I felt when I was able to convince her to start packing sandwiches for lunch. On that day, I opened my lunch box to reveal black forest ham and a single cheese slice stuck between two soggy whole-wheat pieces of bread; the bread might as well have been one-hundred percent whole-wheat because I was one-hundred percent not satisfied. I could feel my blood boil – the eight-year old me just wanted a decent lunch. I mentally prepared myself to yell at her that very night as I gobbled away at the sandwich. That said, the moment she got home from work, I sensed how tired she was and how insatiable I was being that I decided not to bring it up. When she asked me how the sandwich tasted, I told her it was great. This is the story of how I ended up eating soggy sandwiches for lunch, but it makes me happy reflecting on this story simply because the sandwiches were made with maternal love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;School was easy but those years were tough. My clothes were hand-me-downs from my older siblings and or cousins. My mom rarely ever bought new toys and gaming consoles were out of the question. It took me a long time to swallow the hard truth that my mom didn’t buy me nice things not because she didn’t love me, but simply because we couldn’t afford them. It was tough for her – she worked two jobs for a good part of my childhood to make ends meet. Everytime I think about how much she sacrificed and how much she will continue to sacrifice, I am reminded of how fortunate I am – so yes, between you and me, I love my mom. I have yet to say those three words to her though. I don’t know – it’s complicated.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="2020"></category><category term="love"></category><category term="mom"></category><category term="life"></category></entry><entry><title>THE BIGGEST LIE</title><link href="/2020/02/the-biggest-lie/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-02-17T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2020-02-17T00:00:00-08:00</updated><author><name>EDIE YE</name></author><id>tag:None,2020-02-17:/2020/02/the-biggest-lie/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest lies I tell myself is I’ll start enjoying myself—I’ll start living—once I finish

this task or when that event happens. This and that. Wait. It’s almost as if my mind doesn’t want
me to live my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do I mean? I mean I keep trying to set myself up. I justify my struggle with an end goal. I tell myself once I finish highschool, once I graduate from university, once I find my significant other, once I start my mortgage–I’ll start living. It’s a means to an end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t want to wake up one day not having really lived my life. I don’t want to wake up one day wondering why time passed so &lt;em&gt;damn fast.&lt;/em&gt; I don’t want to be nostalgic of a life that I never even lived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always tell myself I know the perfect life exists–I just need to finish everything at hand. Then I’ll be happy. I tell myself the vision of an ideal life is within my grasp—I just need to skip some pages of my story. I have become so enamoured with looking ahead that I have forgotten to live for the now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to start treasuring things. I want to start treasuring every late night conversation I have, every sunset and sunrise I witness, and every opportunity I get to spend with my family and friends. Because this is it. This is my life.

That said, since you are already here, let me answer the impossible to the best of my ability. Let me first ask you a few sub-questions—&lt;strong&gt;what&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;where&lt;/strong&gt; are we in the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmos"&gt;cosmos&lt;/a&gt;?, &lt;strong&gt;why&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;how&lt;/strong&gt; does gravity prevent us from spinning off into space?, &lt;strong&gt;who&lt;/strong&gt; created the first form of life?, &lt;strong&gt;if&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;when&lt;/strong&gt; will time one day pass in reverse?, and &lt;strong&gt;what&lt;/strong&gt; are the ultimate limits to humans can know?
These questions, similar to the meaning of life, are difficult to answer yet have beauty because they are of the unknown. That said, maybe the meaning of life is simply, here and now. Maybe the journey—the struggling, the frustration, the hard work, and the tears themselves is the point. Maybe don't be so focused on searching for the meaning of life when the meaning of life is to give it meaning. Maybe, just maybe, the point is to avoid controlling things and just, well, &lt;em&gt;live&lt;/em&gt;. As &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1065073/characters/nm3878243"&gt;Nicole&lt;/a&gt; would say, “You know how everyone’s always saying seize the moment? I don’t know, I’m kinda thinking its the other way around. You know, like the moment seizes us.”&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="2020"></category><category term="pelican"></category><category term="life"></category><category term="meaning"></category><category term="cosmos"></category><category term="gravity"></category><category term="moment"></category></entry><entry><title>WHAT DOES SUCCESS LOOK LIKE</title><link href="/2020/01/what-does-success-look-like/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-01-13T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2020-01-13T00:00:00-08:00</updated><author><name>EDIE YE</name></author><id>tag:None,2020-01-13:/2020/01/what-does-success-look-like/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The question “What makes one successful in life?” can usually be answered with a tangible good (e.g. money) or an abstract thought (e.g. power).

That said, a fundamental problem to such answers is the possible controversy that can arise. The reason being is that success tends to fall in the hands of the beholder, meaning that there is no universal truth to success that is shared amongst everyone. The sub-questions that then follow are “How do you measure success?” or even more simply, “What is the definition of success?” The &lt;a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/webster-s-dictionary"&gt;Webster Dictionary&lt;/a&gt; defines
&lt;a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/success"&gt;success&lt;/a&gt; as “the fact of getting or achieving, wealth, respect or fame” which again, can be the definition for some people or the majority even, but that definition is not universal. At different points in life, the definitions and or measurements of success change. For this reason, I will write more on what intrinsic traits a successful person possesses rather than trying to draw a picture of a successful person. Although I am by no means at the stage where I can label myself as successful per se, I will delve into this topic further by sharing some of my successful experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the earliest memories I have of my childhood takes me back to my first days or week of preschool. I, for whatever reason, was riddled with separation anxiety from my grandpa, who at the time, was not only my guardian, but my best friend as well. It was honestly a strange concept because I remembered each child that was dropped off by a family member or guardian, and their ability to immediately interact with children and toys around them after being dropped off. Anyways, my grandpa had to remain with me while I interacted with the other kids and I remember every time he made a futile attempt to sneak away, I would cry almost immediately. The whole process of me getting comfortable with everyone took around a week and, if I remember correctly, it wasn’t until that period was over that I was able to be without the presence of my grandpa. While this may be seen as an embarrassment to others or a questionable experience even, it was my first memorable taste of victory and success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;BE PATIENT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In hindsight, there are a number of general accomplishments that happen in our lives whether we realize this or not, not limited to but including learning to walk, to read, or even to use the toilet. While these events have transpired quite a period of time ago, it is important to recognize the amount of time and energy that went into being successful with these tasks. This brings me to the first attribute of being successful—learning to &lt;strong&gt;be patient.&lt;/strong&gt; As cliche as it sounds, success is not something that happens over night. I say this because as a child, I believe that one of the traits many of us shared was not giving up easily and having the courage to attempt new activities, hence being able to effectively learn to verbally communicate, socially interact with others, etc. Speaking entirely for myself, I realized as I grew older, I saw a shift in how much quicker I would need to see results before deeming activities as worth the time. I saw while I was learning to be more patient with others, how impatient I was when it came to myself. The reason behind this is as I grew older, I learned more about myself. When I say learning more about myself, I mean understanding my goals, aspirations, likes, and dislikes. I mean having expectations for myself, which I hold to the highest standard. While it is so, so important to have goals and aspirations, this is a reminder to myself and everyone to be patient with not only the people around them but with themselves as well because success will come with time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;BE RESPECTFUL&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was fifteen, I took on my first job at the &lt;a href="https://www.pne.ca/"&gt;PNE&lt;/a&gt; as a sweeper and this has been rewarding in every aspect. It was not the job duties itself that was monumental nor was there a life changing event that took my breath away. However, it taught me about the value of money (because your sweat translating to your first pay cheque is a woohoo moment), about consistency, and most importantly, about hard work. I then went on to pick up other work prior to the beginning of my software development career, including serving in a restaurant, working in retail, working in concession stands, and even working as a manager in my high school store. If you want to read more about where I interned or where I am currently working you can read more &lt;a href="edieye.ca/about"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Needless to say, I would love to go into detail about each of my work experiences, but it would stray too far from the point I am trying to establish—learning to treat everyone you meet with respect and as an opportunity to learn. &lt;strong&gt;Being respectful&lt;/strong&gt; is of great value and realizing that every person you meet can teach you something will never, ever hinder your growth. This is because the people you meet can teach you what to be and what not to be. I believe, every now and then, quite unintentionally, someone teaches you something about yourself. I say this because I remember serving at a restaurant and witnessing dishwashers being treated poorly by some servers. I remember there was a basket which was intended for the server to put their dirty dishes in. Some servers, out of laziness, would toss dishes that still had food remains into the said basket and remains or sauces would deflect back onto the dishwashers’ clothes or face, even. Of course, this was of the rarest occasions and, of course, the servers apologized but there was, without a doubt, a blatant disregard for the dishwasher. Had it been someone of a deemed, valuable position, I doubt the dishes would have been carelessly tossed into the basket. Yes, I am elucidating the impression that some people are condescending and mistreat others and yes, I am asking you to not behave in this manner because not only is it a backwards movement, but it hinders growth. It is beneficial to recognize the value of every person you meet and every experience that takes place because growth comes from reflection, and not from exuding negativity towards others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;BE CONFIDENT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last trait I want to talk about is one I struggled with for a good period of time—&lt;strong&gt;being confident.&lt;/strong&gt; I say this to the people that don’t believe they have what it takes to take themselves to the level they aspire to be to find the courage to do so. My prior anecdote about my preschool experience is a translation for the parts of my life where I honestly felt uncomfortable being under my own skin. Truth is, you have to put yourself in uncomfortable situations because these situations will eventually become comfortable to you. For example, take a look at typing with a keyboard. At one point in our lives, we probably used two index fingers and had trouble typing a complete sentence without looking up at the screen. After finishing the sentence, being slightly smug about it, and then looking at our screen again, we probably realized that we had mistyped. &lt;em&gt;How uncomfortable.&lt;/em&gt; I understand that for some people, even getting out of bed and having basic conversation with others can be exhausting, but recognize that as long as you take baby steps to work on being comfortable with the uncomfortable, the confidence will eventually come! With that said, it is also important to recognize the difference between being arrogant and confident. As &lt;a href="https://theoffice.fandom.com/wiki/Vikram"&gt;Vikram&lt;/a&gt; would say, “confidence, it’s the food of the wise man, but the liquor of the fool.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many traits that can help lead one to success but those are the three I am trying to work on in the coming year and I know how cliche these traits are made out to be. Truth is, everything in life is cliche. The idea that you are very different from someone else is only true if you consider a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree"&gt;decision tree&lt;/a&gt;, where each step or decision would alter the course of life. However, these branches very often intersect and lead to a similar path. Even the idea that you think you are different is not much different than the other millions of people that have shared this thought , and with that said, I truly believe anyone can feel or be successful regardless of how many bad branches that stemmed from their tree. I have digressed again but I believe success is intrinsic and can not be answered with some social status or some physical good. Success is ultimately looking in the mirror and liking what you see.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="2020"></category><category term="pelican"></category><category term="self"></category><category term="patience"></category><category term="memory"></category><category term="success"></category><category term="life"></category><category term="confidence"></category></entry></feed>
